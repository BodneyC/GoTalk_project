GoTalk
======

More than anything this is a project to get learning the fundamentals of GoLang. I was trying to think of something to make and came across the suggestion of a simple chat application. Having never made anything like it before I am basing it quite heavily off a couple of sources I found online, most notably [this project](https://github.com/coolspeed/century/blob/master/century.go).

From some very light testing I seem to have it working

## Install

```bash
go build GoTalk.go
./GoTalk
```

## Usage

- Provide it with a port
- Connect (via localhost only as it stands) via (for example) telnet
- Send and receive
